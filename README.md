# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Prediction-using-ML-Models


The hotel industry, a major player in various sectors, faces daily challenges with reservation cancellations, impacting demand management. Despite employing strict policies and overbooking strategies, cancellations can harm a hotel's income and reputation. To address this, a machine learning-based system prototype predicts booking cancellations, enabling hotels to proactively manage demand. This model analyzes daily data from a property management system, identifying reservations likely to cancel and allowing hotels to offer tailored incentives. The study underscores the efficacy of machine learning in predicting cancellations and emphasizes the need for constant model retraining to prevent concept drift.
